Working with APIs :
    API is a link to a server. for example :
    https://reqres.in/api/users?page=2


Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is an application-layer protocol for transmitting hypermedia documents, such as HTML. It was designed for communication between web browsers and web servers, but it can also be used for other purposes.


API tools : 
    1. fetch() : native java script.

        fetch('http://example.com/movies.json')
        .then(response => response.json())
        .then(data => console.log(data));

    2. axios : react library.
